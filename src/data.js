      `An ISCHGL NFT is a unique digital image of a snow sculpture from the limited series of Shapes in White 2024 with a total of only XXXX unique images each. (to be announced)`,
      `Each NFT is a limited and unique collector's item, which additionally includes some highlights, such as the right to an unforgettable Ischgl event.`,
      `NFT = "Non-Fungible Token"`,
      `An NFT is a unique file, whose unique proof of ownership is stored decentrally in a blockchain for all to see. Therefore, each NFT has a single owner and can only be resold by that owner.`,
      `An NFT cannot be copied or exchanged for another file and is therefore unique. NFT's can take the form of music, photos and other digital collectibles, including books, blogs or even tweets.`,
      `NFTs are essentially unique autographs , that a person can own outside of the analog world. NFT's can be shared and consumed, but not duplicated, creating digital scarcity and proof of ownership.`,

    title: "How do NFTs work?",
    descriptions: [
      `NFTs allow users to own digital assets such as virtual real estate, art, digital sneakers, and video moments. The concept of digital assets is similar to in-app purchases of items in video games. The big difference with NFTs is their uniqueness and the ability to easily transfer them to another owner thanks to blockchain technology.`,
      `Each minted NFT is a verifiably unique asset, worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. With some experts warning that over 50% of all art on the market is likely to be counterfeit, the risks of investing in physical art are high. NFTs offer a solution to this problem by providing a way for artists to prove the provenance of their works and create a chain of ownership using the blockchain ledger.`,

    title: "What makes a blockchain unique?",
    descriptions: [
      `A blockchain is a decentralized system, which means that data is stored on the network rather than in one place. This means that transactions are recorded by all users of the blockchain network and any change to the transaction record must be confirmed by the vast majority of blockchain users to be recognized as legitimate.`,

As opposed to so-called proof-of-work, Ethereum now uses proof-of-stake validation, which means lower energy consumption.`,
